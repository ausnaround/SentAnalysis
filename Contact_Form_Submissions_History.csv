 ,Coworking or Flexible Workspaces,"Hello
 
 
 
 I'm reaching out to discuss a comprehensive solution for managing the rental of offices and a meeting room within our property. Unlike typical coworking spaces, we exclusively rent out entire offices of varying sizes, not individual desks. This distinction is crucial for our model, catering to businesses seeking private, dedicated spaces. Below are our specific requirements:
 
 
 
 1. Exclusive Office Rental: Our focus is on renting entire offices, not desks. Businesses must have the option to select and secure a specific office on a monthly basis, emphasizing the importance of direct selection to ensure tenants receive their preferred space.
 
 
 
 2. Access Control System Integration: Integration with an access control system (Salto, Nuki, or Dormakaba) is mandatory. Access should be directly tied to payment status, ensuring only those who have paid can access their specific rented office.
 
 
 
 3. Meeting Room Booking Flexibility: Besides offices, we offer a meeting room available for booking on an hourly, half-day, or full-day basis. This service requires integrated payment processing.
 
 
 
 4. Automated Billing and Payment Processing: Automatic invoice generation and payment processing are required to minimize administrative tasks and streamline operations.
 
 
 
 Given our unique focus on entire office rentals rather than hot desking, can your system cater to our needs? We're keen on understanding how your solution can be tailored to our model, especially with previous case studies or examples of similar implementations. A demo to see the system in action would be highly beneficial.
 
 
 
 Looking forward to your detailed response and hoping your solution aligns with our requirements.

United Kingdom,Other,"Hello,
 
 I am investigating a question in regards to the integration between Nexudus and Xero.
 
 Is this integration API? 
 
 When one member is assigned one location but then books out another location, the invoice and therefore income is going into the wrong P&L account. My question is whether the member can be assigned mutliple locations and therefore can we choose which location to invoice them? 
 
 If not, is there an easy way to reconcile this within Xero? Such as seperating some elements within the accounting?

 Hi there,
 
 
 
 How are you?
 
 
 
 I came across your website and I noticed that it is a great resource for coworking spots. My name is Luís and I am the Cowork Manager of Kübe Coworking, a company that is currently developing its first coworking space.
 
 
 
 I believe that a backlink from your site to ours would be mutually beneficial. Our site provides valuable products and resources for freelancers and companies in the coworking world, which would be a great addition to your website's existing content. Also, you would be invited to try out our space for a day for free :) 
 
 
 
 In return, a backlink from your site would help us increase our visibility and reach a wider audience. I would be happy to provide you with information about us for your review. 
 
 
 
 Let me know if this is something that interests you, and I would be happy to provide more information.
 
 
 
 Thank you for your time and consideration.
 
 
 
 Best,

 Upon reviewing your website, I've noticed that it lacks many functionalities and features that could greatly benefit your business and enhance the user experience for your visitors. Additionally, I attempted to find your website using relevant keywords, but it did not appear in Google search results. This is likely due to a lack of SEO (search engine optimization). As a result, your website may not be generating the traffic, sales, or revenue it could potentially achieve.
 
 
 
 Let's schedule a phone call to discuss these matters in detail. I'm confident that we can resolve these issues within a few weeks. Please reply to this email with your time availability, phone number, time zone you follow and i will call accordingly.
 
 
 
 Thank you,

 We are a coworking and offer complementary services such as consulting and programs. Along that, we host multiple events per year.
 
 
 
 We are now evaluaiting a new coworking software, as our current build consists of airtable + planyo. Nexudus is on our shortlist but we are still at the beginning of our evaluation.
 
 
 
 We'd like to test the software a bit and would like to start by publishing some events to the platform. We wouldn't want to onboard the whole coworking, as this would be an enormous step, which we are not ready to take yet.

Andorra,Coworking or Flexible Workspaces,"Good morning,
 
 
 
 We are in the process of establishing a coworking space in Andorra, a small country nestled between Spain and France. We are in the early stages, with our building under construction, which means completion will take a few months (the exact timeframe is yet to be determined). We are eager to learn about integrating with Nexudus and other operational details. Our proficiency in English is basic, and we wonder if you could provide a demo in Spanish, French, Portuguese, or Catalan. If an English demo is the only option, we will accommodate.
 
 
 
 In addition to seeking advice on essential integrations for a coworking space, we have a few more queries:
 
 
 
 Customization: How customizable is the Nexudus platform in terms of layout and branding to align with our coworking space's unique identity?
 
 
 
 Member Management: Could you elaborate on the member management features, particularly how they handle different membership levels and access privileges?
 
 
 
 Training and Support: Do you offer training for new clients, and what does your ongoing support look like? Are there resources or a community forum for additional help?
 
 
 
 Payment Processing: How does Nexudus handle payment processing, and are there integrations with popular payment gateways that we should be aware of?
 
 
 
 Future Scalability: As we look to grow, how well does Nexudus scale with expanding coworking spaces? Are there features that specifically support scaling up?
 
 
 
 Security Integrations: We are considering partnering with Kisi for door security using NFC cards or mobile phones. How would this integrate with Nexudus?
 
 
 
 Feedback from Existing Clients: Could you provide any case studies or feedback from current clients who have set up new coworking spaces using Nexudus?
 
 
 
 We are committed to this project and aim to make informed decisions every step of the way. Your guidance in these matters would be greatly appreciated.
 
 
 
 Thank you for your assistance.",15/01/2024 11:29

 It's a pleasure to meet you! I'm reaching out as a potential integration partner. At Relynk we developed a data platform to help companies like Nexudus access a commercial building's real-time data through our APIs. We collect a range of data such as usage statistics, indoor environmental conditions, electricity consumption and more.
 
 
 
 Seeing that you also offer workspace analytics, I feel there are areas we could collaborate on. Would you be interested in having a brief discussion around this sometime next week?
 
 
 
 Looking forward to hearing from you.

Bolivia,Coworking or Flexible Workspaces,"Dear Nexudus Support Team,
 
 
 
 I hope you are doing well. I am writing to inquire about the possibility of integrating Nexudus with a local access control system that utilizes its own API and SDK.
 
 
 
 We are interested in syncing user access permissions and receiving updates on access events within Nexudus. Could you please advise if such an integration is feasible through webhooks or other means, especially considering the system is custom and runs locally. Technically it should be possible through some web server or tunnel as middleware.
 
 
 
 Would we be able to use the white label passport App to open all accesses with our custom access control system through tiles?
 
 
 
 with kind regards,

Australia,Coworking or Flexible Workspaces,"Hello, 
 
 
 
 Before we go forward with a demo I wouldn’t to provide context on the business and the solution we are after. 
 
 
 
 Please see additional info to see if this tool meets our requirements. If yes, we can go ahead with the demo. 
 
 
 
 Study Melbourne is a Vic Government initiative for international students onshore and offshore.
 
 
 
 We are in the process of redeveloping the Study Melbourne website and, as part of this, want to improve our seat booking functionality. The booking platform we select should ideally be able to integrate with our web CMS: SQUIZ MATRIX, meet our security requirements on data and apply the Study Melbourne branding (colours, logo, CSS).
 
 
 
 We want to use the desk space booking platform to service our Study Hubs: https://www.studymelbourne.vic.gov.au/Hubs 
 
 
 
 The Hubs are based in Melbourne, KL and HCMC . 
 
 
 
 The intended use if for the public (international students who are external to the organisation) to be able to book a desk/ room at the Hub free of charge. 
 
 
 
 Currently HCMC Hub for example is using the booking CMS GlueUp which is live: https://app.glueup.com/event/60111/register/
 
 
 
 The ideal user journey is: Members of the public (students) will visit the Study Melbourne Hub page and read about the Hub and the spaces it offers and then click book now and be taken to your tool - they can then book a room/desk during the week at different times, and can provide their name and email for the booking form (which we can customise), as well as subscribe to our NL and privacy terms. Once the student books they get a confirmation email/ and or a QR code to confirm their booking/visitor management. 
 
 
 
 The backend: Allows admin to set the number of seats/desks, rooms, availability, amenities. They can also see analytics of the space, but also export the names and emails of people who have used the space. 
 
 
 
 The Study Hub spaces are free of cost, so the public doesn’t need to pay to use the space. Users can book multiple spaces under one booking, and can manage their bookings as required.
 
 
 
 We also don’t require a floorplan, and ideally just a calendar and booking form is sufficient, where we can set room/space/desk availabilities.
 
 
 
 We also need to ensure the tool complies with security and accessibility requirements that meets Vic Gov standards. 
 
 
 
 We would like to be able to brand the tool as Study Melbourne and have a custom subdomain. It also needs to be seamless on mobile devices. 
 
 
 
 We can explain further on the call if you have any questions, but hope this additional information helps! 😊",05/10/2023 03:41

France,Coworking or Flexible Workspaces,"Hello, 
 
 I'm contacting you because I work for a coworking company in Paris and we're looking for alternatives to our SAAS meeting room reservation system. 
 
 
 
 - We have three coworking locations in Paris with a total of 9 meeting rooms with different capacities from 2 to 6 people. 
 
 I understand from your website that you offer this service, but I can't find any information on how you work or how much you charge. 
 
 - Being a nomad space, we don't know in advance if our rooms are going to be booked and therefore we don't know the exact number of people we can accommodate in a month. Does this have an impact on pricing? 
 
 - If pricing is based on the number of bookings validated and paid for via the platform, is a commission charged on each booking? Or is it a fixed monthly fee (I see it's €150 per month for 80 ""users"" included)? What do ""users"" correspond to? 
 
 - In addition, we collaborate with business introducers such as Worklib and Néonomade and give them access to our Google calendar via an authorization so that bookings generated on their side can appear directly on our own calendar to avoid duplication. Is this service available on your site? 
 
 - Do you have a simplified user space enabling our teams to manage schedules without having to go through the administrator interface?
 
 - Is the application also available in French?
 
 
 
 Thank you in advance for your answers

 we are a vending machine company, we provide coffee/snack services to more than 50 clients in Slovakia. Recently our client - Slovak Telekom has been interested in having a Scanomat Topbrewer in their business lounge. We agreed upon the delivery and other services, however there is a small issue in implementing a singular payment system for every team and employee. We need our TopBrewer to be able to accept card payments via Sumup Card reader for approx. 700 employees and for the other approx 100 employees we have to provide a pre-paid invoice payment method, which is going to be paid each month by the HQ. Those are mostly marketing teams and managers. 
 
 
 
 Is there a way you can help us implementing some sort of payment system, which is going to accept on-spot credit card payments + availability for the teams to purchase a coffee which is going to be invoiced later? (for the teams we only need way to keep count of coffees made)
 
 
 
 We also thought of implementing a system with a company Payhawk which could provide us with max 250 custom made credit cards which can be given to the teams, but their rates, monthly fees and contract drations are quite high. We are open to every recommendation, suggestion or even buying a software solution from you which would suit this situation we are in.

We need our TopBrewer to be able to accept card payments via Sumup Card reader for approx. 700 employees and for the other approx 100 employees we have to provide a pre-paid invoice payment method, which is going to be paid each month by the HQ. Those are mostly marketing teams and managers. 
 
 
 
 Is there a way you can help us implementing some sort of payment system, which is going to accept on-spot credit card payments + availability for the teams to purchase a coffee which is going to be invoiced later? (for the teams we only need way to keep count of coffees made)
 
 
 
 We also thought of implementing a system with a company Payhawk which could provide us with max 250 custom made credit cards which can be given to the teams, but their rates, monthly fees and contract drations are quite high. We are open to every recommendation, suggestion or even buying a software solution from you which would suit this situation we are in. 
 
 
 
 Thank you in advance.

 My setup
 
 BSR - member at Mills Fabrica - has offices in several cities but not our own in UK/London, as we don't have as many employees yet. Therefore we found a shared office space.
 
 Some employee goes every week, those further away goes 3-4 times a month. Colleagues from other offices/countries comes to visit from time to time and Mills has set up an option for 'day passes' - but I support my BSR colleagues and would like to book on behalf of others. Of course I am not with Mills, so I can't be the overall system admin but it would be so much easier if I could be the member account admin so I can see all bookings and book day passes, rooms etc. on behalf of others (that already has a profile). Right now I can only book in my own name.
 
 
 
 Please reach out if you would like me to clarify.
 
 I just wanted to give you this suggestion for future development of the platform, as I know that Hermione from Mills has reached out to you to ask if the above would be an option.

 I am a portfolio manager for a CRE investor based in Zurich. We are exploring options to expand a part of our portfolio into co-working models and perhaps also into co-living models, and would like to open up a dialogue with Nexudus to see if your product could make sense for us.

 I plan to use your app to manage my upcoming workspace (https://cococo.space).
 
 
 
 The space will be ready only by November, but we are already doing events and building the community here.
 
 
 
 We want to start letting people signup and book the events, so we already have a customer database before we fully operate.
 
 However, it doesn't really make sense for us to start paying for your app without any income (events are free)....
 
 
 
 We were thinking to use another solution for now, and then importing the contacts, is that possible? 
 
 Or is there any chance to get your platform for a longer trial until we start operating, so we can already get people to sign up and have accounts?
 
 
 
 Thanks a lot,

 I have a quick question:
 
 
 
 Is your solution also designed to let the meeting rooms in a multitenant building be booked by both the employees located there and external people from outside the companies? External users should not have to be created as users by an admin beforehand, but should ideally be able to make the booking independently and on their own initiative for example on a public website / application.
 
 
 
 Thanks in advance and best regards,

 I'm reaching out because I'd like to set up a product demo with your team. My and my team are in the process of setting up a cowork space here in Trinidad & Tobago. I've come across your platform in a few different publications, and it seems like it checks all the boxes.
 
 
 
 Me and some of my partners would love to get on a call with you to see the demo, ask a few questions, and take it from there.
 
 
 
 Thanks,

,Coworking or Flexible Workspaces,"I manage a coworking space based in Sydney and would love to streamline my processes for invoicing, booking rooms, visitor management, etc.
 
 
 
 My main priority is streamlining our invoice management system as it is currently manual (combination of spreadsheet + Xero). However, most subscription management services don't quite cover all the nuances of a coworking space and its need for flexibility.
 
 
 
 When it comes to subscriptions, our priorities are:
 
 - Giving members control of updating their membership. I.e. Customers can see their current subscriptions and changes/pause their membership for the next billing cycle.
 
 - Members can manage multiple (and often different) memberships. E.g. a big team with hybrid work models with a mix of monthly and pay-as-you-go contracts
 
 - Pro-rated and custom invoices. E.g. for customers that sign up halfway through the billing cycle;members that buy 10-day passes, etc.
 
 - Customer-facing interface/portal, ideally able to be embedded on our website.

,Coworking or Flexible Workspaces,"Hello, I am trying to handle all of the backend things on Nexudus so that all members and teams have no trouble booking resources, plans, prodcuts etc. However I am having difficulties and would love a representative to help me. These are some questions I listed in my notes:
 
 
 
 Why am I unable to delete resource types
 
 
 
 How do I add a bank account to receive payment from members
 
 
 
 How to delete products (the system tells me to first delete product sales) where can I do that?
 
 
 
 How do I delete resource categories (delete meeting rooms)
 
 
 
 I need everyone to pay for plans + resources the moment they book them. In backend, in settings when I add a minimum price to pay for each plan, it doubles the listing price (misleading to members and guest)
 
 
 
 Under resources, some of my resources available have multiple ratings, it can be booked in 3 different options (1,5 or 10 day), as well as a monthly membership option. Why can’t members see each rating option when they want to book the desk? The only one customers can see is the 1 day rating. How can I fix this issue so that customers can see every option available for each resource as well as make a payment as they book.

However now I have conference rooms coming up on my road map, I've since opened some amenity spaces, etc and I feel I need to get a better grasp on the management of it all. 
 
 
 
 However I am not an actual coworking space. I own an office building that is moving towards heavy amenity offerings and so I am interested to speak with someone about how I can adapt the Nexudus platform to work for my application.

 we are a technology partner, Cusna.io (the form was not taking my business email).
 
 We provide an innovative way to handle WiFi for tenants, also in co-working spaces, and we have interesting projects coming up in our pipeline of customers using Nexudus. Our product doesn't use captive portals such as your existing WiFi integration, but rather it provides simple and secure WiFi using PPSK technology.
 
 We'd like to perform an integration with Nexudus and we'd like to ask a sandbox or a demo account for dev and testing purposes. Is it possible to have one?
 
 
 
 Thanks,
 
 Ivan
 
 
 
 Use case: the use case would be to allow Tenants (Customers) to login in their portal to create/change their personal WiFi passwrod. The idea is to just let the user enter the email address, we will check in nexudus via APIs if it exists, and if it does we mail a magic link to login directly to our portal. In this way we provide a self-serve portal to workspace teams and we can make sure that only active customers can access it.",11/02/2023 15:43

,Coworking or Flexible Workspaces,"I had looked at the Nexudus platform awhile back but to be honest I didn't have time to really dive too deep into it's functionality and how it could work/adapt for my use. However now I have conference rooms coming up on my road map, I've since opened some amenity spaces, etc and I feel I need to get a better grasp on the management of it all. 
 
 
 
 However I am not an actual coworking space. I own an office building that is moving towards heavy amenity offerings and so I am interested to speak with someone about how I can adapt the Nexudus platform to work for my application. 
 
 
 
 Thank you in advance!

 I was wondering if it is possible to easily add your software to a website that is already made. Additionally, my client is heavily reliant on Microsoft Teams for their day-to-day operations and it would be ideal if your platform could be integrated with Microsoft Teams. Specifically, they would like to be able to see all the booked spaces in their calendar on Teams.
 
 
 
 Please let me know if this is something that is possible and if you have any additional information or resources that would be helpful for me to share with my client.
 
 
 
 Reply per mail please.
 
 
 
 Thank you for your time,

 We are looking to automate our processes so I am wondering if you can accommodate any of the following needs:
 
 - upon booking for clients to choose different booking options: hourly booking;4-hour block booking;full-day booking - and each booking to maybe have different restrictions, specifics, and cost
 
 - have calendar view of meeting rooms and bookings
 
 flexible settings for calculating fees or at least options to manually write different fees to be invoiced or bulk uploading of different fees for each client. Our business model is - the more a client uses our rooms, the lower the price per booking;depending on the number of bookings at the end of the month the price can vary so we are looking for flexibility in the invoice process
 
 - options to customize the invoice content to fit Bulgarian regulations (for example, to have everything be in Bulgarian, include specific text, relating to VAT, etc.)
 
 integration with control of access systems 
 
 - integrations with our website, allowing booking of available rooms and payment directly from the website
 
 - options to manage multiple locations and allow clients to use both and have the information show up on their account
 
 - easy exporting of monthly room booking
 
 - option to track memberships and notify clients when membership is close to expiring
 
 - client onboarding 
 
 - ticketing system for client complaints
 
 - options for mass messaging of clients
 
 - CRM system, allowing to keep track of current and past clients, as well as leads?",18/12/2022 09:12

 I had originally tried to sign up for an account through https://highlandshub.spaces.nexudus.com/
 
 
 
 but i was getting an error when I tried to sign up with my primary email address robey@beardedfriend.com 
 
 I think I've used this address previously with Nexudus, but I wasn't getting any of the password reset emails when I was trying to reset my password.
 
 
 
 So I signed up the new account with robey+nexudus@beardedfriend.com
 
 
 
 That went fine and I could login. 
 
 Then an admin of the highlandshub Nexudus instance elevated me to an Admin as I am helping them with some website integrations.

 It has very limited capabilities when it comes to invoicing, which has been an accounting nightmare.

To utilize a proof service concept via NFC and QR codes in the space and show transparency and accountability the cleaning company can offer a a free introduction with only those specific features and then present the value added if the space/building management - the client is presented with all Nexudus amazing features that they can benefit from. It is a win win for the cleaning team and their client. We are willing to test this approach in our own commercial cleaning clients accounts in Orlando, Fl under the white labeled solution ""ProofQoD"" - where later will be marketing the opportunity to other commercial cleaners in USA via our network.

,Other,"Hi, we would like to propose a different angle of a case study approach, where Nexudus in partnership with ProofQoD is introduced in Commercial buildings and spaces by Commercial cleaning companies already operating in this spaces. To utilize a proof service concept via NFC and QR codes in the space and show transparency and accountability the cleaning company can offer a a free introduction with only those specific features and then present the value added if the space/building management - the client is presented with all Nexudus amazing features that they can benefit from. It is a win win for the cleaning team and their client. We are willing to test this approach in our own commercial cleaning clients accounts in Orlando, Fl under the white labeled solution ""ProofQoD"" - where later will be marketing the opportunity to other commercial cleaners in USA via our network. Our company has been in operations for more than 15 years with great reputation established. 
 
 Please let us know if we can achieve that strategy via partnership with you?

 We are a smart building systems integrator from Malaysia interested in integrating Nexudus meeting room booking solution with our air conditioning and lighting control system.
 
 
 
 Typically our air conditioning and lighting control system runs on open protocols e.g. BACnet, KNX, etc.
 
 
 
 We would like to have further discussion with you to explore the possibility and feasibility of performing such integration activity.
 
 
 
 Would you be open to demo Nexudus and chat with us?

The Client already employs Nexus software at various other sites around the country and would like to utilise again for this project which will be combined office, co-working and flexible space. 
 
 
 
 My query is regarding access control to lifts / compatibility with lift destination control systems. Is this something Nexudus already provides? Are their limitations on destination control hardware / software if we are looking to utilise the Nexudus system? We are also partnering with Salto for this project whom I understand already partner with Nexudus, that is to say who's devices are compatible with the software.
 
 
 
 Any confirmation / advice you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

 At YouTube, we’re dedicated to stopping the spread of online child exploitation videos. In this spirit, we believe our commitment to the fight means making innovative technology available across the industry, including technology companies and NGOs.
 
 
 
 CSAI Match is YouTube’s proprietary technology for combating CSAI (Child Sexual Abuse Imagery) content online. This technology allows us to identify known CSAI content in a sea of innocent content. When a match of CSAI content is found, it is then flagged to partners to responsibly report in accordance to local laws and regulations.

 Who can use CSAI Match
 
 
 
 YouTube makes CSAI Match available to partners in industry and NGOs. We give access to fingerprinting software and an API to identify matches against our database of known abusive content.
 
 
 
 Companies and NGOs already participating include:
 
 
 
 “CSAI Match was straightforward to deploy and quickly proved itself a very effective tool in our ongoing fight against the online distribution of child sexual exploitation content.”

 FAQ
 
 
 
 Find answers to your CSAI Match questions below.
 
 
 
 Does CSAI Match work for images?
 
 
 
 CSAI Match is designed for video, but through Google’s Content Safety API, a collection of tools are available to industry and NGO partners, offering machine learning powered classification for images. Learn more.
 
 
 
 What information is returned with an identified match?
 
 
 
 The match will identify which portion of the video matches known CSAI, as well as a standardized categorization of the type of content that was matched.
 
 
 
 What happens when a query returns a positive match for CSAI?
 
 
 
 Child Sexual Abuse Content is illegal in most places and a provider may have legal obligations to report the incident. In the US, service providers are required to report such content to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. CSAI Match allows you to find this content before it’s exposed to your users.
 
 
 
 What happens in the event of a false positive?
 
 
 
 In the rare case of a false positive, we will work with the provider to resolve the issue.

 Maybe you can imagine what that means for us and how much confusion that causes.

It's called mangrove (mangrove.city) But now we're planning to make some co-working & stay projects in rural areas in South Korea. like a workation (work with vataion) hybrid model.

Gallery bookings by artists and creatives can be as often as every week where as the tenancies for the studio members tend to be 6 month +. In the expansion we would also be offering bookable meeting spaces and a makers space.

,Coworking or Flexible Workspaces,What access control systems do you recommend? Kisi seems too expensive. I need an estimate for the costs of installation on the access control system for 6 doors. Any recommendations or maybe you worked with other coworking spaces in the past and could ask them what they end up paying for smart locks on the all the doors and the other expenses that come with using Nexodus and all it's features? We can afford the software but all the hardware and other services to utilize nexodus to its full potential might put us out of the ballgame in terms of investment right now.,28/05/2022 05:38

,Consultant / Technology Provider,"Hi, I am a software engineer of Panenco. We are building a new platform for coworkings to expose their rooms to users of the platform (https://www.xwork.cool/). Some of our customers are using Nexudus to manage their workspace. Currently we are looking into integrating Nexudus with our platform. The integration requires several steps.
 
 - The people from the coworking space setup the link 
 
 - When a booking is created in Xwork, we send it to Nexudus
 
 - Update the booking 
 
 - Delete the booking
 
 - Get the availabilities of a certain meeting room
 
 - Get all buildings of a Nexudus user
 
 - Get all meeting rooms of a building
 
 - Get details of a meeting room / building
 
 
 
 While reading your documentation, two questions came up:
 
 - Which API would be the best for these requirements? To us it seems the rest API would be a good fit. How can we start testing this?
 
 - What is your point of view on the authentication flow? As we will need to fetch the availability without a user entering the username and password

 I'm a consultant working on defining a digital roadmap for our client that manage an office community of 90 offices. We were inspired from our visit to your customer, SOHO in Copenhagen, and wanted to dive deeper into their solution. The client is currently exploring the platform through demos but asked me to inquire about the pricing model. I found the pricing calculator on your site but was wondering which apps/modules is included. 
 
 Is there a base license plus add-ons or how is the pricing model structured? What about onboarding and support? Could you give me some estimates, considering that they might need meeting room booking, digital reception, member portal/app and perhaps delivery of packages? How much would it be for a platform similar to the one Soho has today?",24/05/2022 14:38

 I'm contacting you from the agency DauHerkert, who is helping the client Brainhouse247 get set up with Necudus. My colleague niklas.diet@dauherkert.de has been in contact with you in the past. 
 
 We are aligning with the client to review their current setup. But to get a first overview of the basic functions, it would be helpful to have a temporary demo account. 
 
 Would it be possible to create one for me?

 Wir benötigen ein Buchungsportal für neue Mitglieder.

 Gern würden wir potenziellen Mietern über unsere Website: https://strandfabrik.sh/ anbieten einen freien Platz für die eigene Produktion zu buchen. 
 
 Es soll angezeigt werden welche Flächen frei sind, wie groß diese sind und wie hoch die Miete dafür ist. Dann soll sich der Mieter einen Platz aussuchen und alle notwendigen Daten direkt am PC/Handy eintragen können. 
 
 
 
 Bisher ist unser Prozess sehr langwierig und nicht automatisiert. Das würden wir gern mit euch ändern. Ist es möglich mal ein Gesprächstermin zu erhalten??

 Good day, 
 
 
 
 my name is Sophie from the Strandfabrik in Kiel-Friedrichsort. 
 
 StrandFabrik GmbH is a shared workspace for production and crafts on the only industrial site in Kiel-Friedrichsort.
 
 
 
 We need a booking portal for new members. 
 
 The process should be as easy as possible to execute for all involved. 
 
 
 
 We would like to offer potential tenants via our website: https://strandfabrik.sh/ to book a free space for their own production. 
 
 It should be shown which spaces are free, how big they are and how much the rent is. Then the tenant should be able to choose a space and enter all necessary data directly on the PC/mobile phone. 
 
 
 
 So far our process is very long and not automated. We would like to change this with you. Is it possible to get an appointment?
 
 
 
 We are looking forward to your feedback.

 We have built on of the largest co-working space network & a hybrid work app four our clients to manage their own shared office & distributed teams. Many of our workspace partners like The Executive Centre (140+) and more, believe that we should integrate with your platform rather than maintaining the location database ourselves.
 
 
 
 The Executive Center would like to start a trial for the integration of our App with their Nexudus account to better support their client.
 
 
 
 I hope we can arrange a call soon to discuss integration capabilities.
 
 Kind regards

,Coworking or Flexible Workspaces,"Hi there
 
 
 
 We trialed several coworking software solutions when we had just opened The Corner Office in 2017, however none of them really worked for us because we were unable to link any South African Payment gateways, and the ones where it WAS possible, the charges/transaction fees for the work around made it unfeasible.
 
 
 
 So, what are your options with regard to South African Payment Gateways? We are currently using PayFast and Zapper, and are with FNB (First National Bank) - if that helps at all?
 
 
 
 Thanks for your time!

 Your website's design is absolutely brilliant. The visuals really enhance your message and the content compels action. I've forwarded it to a few of my contacts who I think could benefit from your services.
 
 
 
 When I was looking at your site, though, I noticed some mistakes that you've made re: search engine optimization (SEO) which may be leading to a decline in your organic SEO results. Would you like to fix it so that you can get maximum exposure/presence on Google, Bing, Yahoo and web traffic to your website?
 
 
 
 It's a relatively simple fix. If this is a priority.
 
 
 
 Please share your “Mobile Number"" and a suitable time to talk, so I can help you in that.

 I am planning to open an unattended screen golf indoor facility with 4~5 simulators in private rooms. And I am currently looking for a booking system that can fit with my business model.
 
 
 
 - payment: online card payments with data analysis
 
 - sales: see all the sales data analysis
 
 - bookings: online booking systems linked with card payment from my own website
 
 - chat or reporting system for instant feedback from/to the customers
 
 - membership: manage memberships (15% discount to the members, monthly pass etc,)
 
 - Gift Card / Prepaid Card: link with payment system as another payment type, maintain and control the balance
 
 - remote access control to the facility - KISI: automatically send out 1 time keyless entry code to the customers after they make bookings (i.e. the code activates 15 mins before their booking time and expires when the booking time ends)
 
 - marketing: collect all the customer info and automatically send out marketing emails
 
 - ability to manage multiple locations
 
 
 
 Please let me know what kind of features / services you offer that can suit my needs.

 My name is Marc, and I'm from ArtsPay, a social good payments provider in Australia and we would love to offer our services to co-working spaces in the territory that are aligned with the arts and music. We use Fat Zebra as our payment gateway, which is already integrated into your system. So it wouldn't be hard to work with spaces. We have spoken to Music Victoria and would be interested in working with others. 
 
 
 
 Would it be possible to connect and discuss any potential partnerships?

 Moving frequently is exciting and fun, but can also be quite complicated without the proper tools in your toolbelt. For example, a trusted moving company to safely get you and your personal belongings from point A to point B tops this list of necessary tools!
 
 
 
 I’d like to write an article for your website on the top cities for solopreneurs and gig economy nomads to explore - and consider moving to - in 2022.

 Capability for members to book meeting room spaces
 
 Option for hourly & “half day” (4 hours) booking

The client is opening an eSports venue (and plans to open more) and some of the requirements of the engagement is to be able to manage desks/workstations/gamestations booking, rooms bookings (as some customers will want a private room to play/stream/learn), integrations with e-locks. Also we need to be able to charge customers managing the payment. In addition we are looking at any capabilities you may have regarding food and beverages.

 I'm looking at Nexudus as a solution for my client. They have an existing website and we are looking at possible integrations. They want to have the co-working functionality, but then some of their services they would like the general public to be able to book. Is there a way that we can embed part of the booking process onto their website? So that non-members can book a service? Or could non-members create a free account to then book services?

 I am reaching out to understand the services you offer. I work for a non for profit organisation called Ngarrimili and we are working on a really exciting project in Geelong. We are opening the first ever First Nations Business and Retail Hub for the First Nations community in Geelong and the surrounding areas. This space will consist of a retail shop, a co-working space, a gallery and meeting rooms. 
 
 
 
 I am reaching out to see whether your organisation would have any interest in being part of this in some capacity. It would be interesting to know more about the services you offer to businesses and how they could work in this hub. The systems we would require would be internet, cloud services, and a system to manage bookings for the co-working space.
 
 
 
 I look forward to hopefully hearing from you soon.

 Curbside Crafters is a space for local crafters to rent pop-up booths and sell their handmade crafts. We are looking for a booking platform that can allow our crafters to easily make their bookings but we have the following requirements: 
 
 1) We have 2 types of booths available for rent - regular and large booths
 
 2) We have 2 types of pricings for the booths - weekday and weekend pricing
 
 3) We have 2 booking requirements
 
 - For weekday bookings, it is compulsory for our crafters to book from Mon to Thurs
 
 - For weekend bookings, it is compulsory for our crafters to book for both Sat & Sunday;and if they want to start their booking on Friday, that's even better 
 
 
 
 We are wondering if Nexudus have the right solution for us. I look forward to hearing from you!",28/12/2021 13:25

 Secondly let me introduce myself, I am an outsourced accountant to one of your customers (Founders Spaces). So despite not being officially employed (and hence the different company email) I have their full confidence as their personal accounting outsourcee (and other Business Process Outsourcing services aswell).
 
 
 
 So now, I would just like to breifly touch upon an issue we have with quickbooks integration, which is that whenever we attempt to transfer invoices formed through nexedus, we face the following error: 
 
 
 
 Quickbooks - Validation Exception was thrown.Details:Business Validation Error: Make sure all your transactions have a sales tax rate before you save.. - [System]
 
 
 
 The thing is, the system already adds a sales tax to the transactions before transferring them to quickbooks, so I dont really understand the issue behind this error message. 
 
 Please advise.

,Workplaces and Teams managing internal bookings,"Good afternoon,
 
 
 
 I hope you’re well.
 
 
 
 I was wondering if it were possible to get a quote / pricing indications and a demo for your room booking system on offer. Ideally we would like a device solution that enables rooms to be booked and is clear to users when a room is booked and when it’s free (possibly by a light system). Would also be great to have monitors outside the room that staff would like to book, so it’s easy to view when a room is occupied and when it’s not.
 
 
 
 Functionality wise we need:
 
 • Integration to Microsoft Outlook / Teams
 
 • Ability to instantly book a room if empty – ie integrate from system to outlook
 
 • Stand alone device with decent battery life
 
 
 
 In terms of specs we will need to have an initial installation that covers 6 meeting rooms, but we will also need to have scope to extend to anywhere between another 6 to 10 rooms.
 
 
 
 I look forward to hearing from you.
 
 
 
 Best,

 We're providing a concierge service to help businesses book workspaces, organise team events, refreshments, etc. A lot of the venues our customers want to book are running Nexudus so we'd like to build an application to integrate with the venue systems.
 
 
 
 Would it be possible to get developer access to a sandbox account for Nexudus that we could use to build basic availability checks and a booking mechanism? That way, we can work with the venues to ensure we're showing live availability and then directly create bookings via API.

 I'm Saül Sanz from the Catalan Foundation of Down Syndrome. We are opening a small coworking&fablab space in Barcelona and we are looking for a program where our clients could book a desk or a room for their work.
 
 Part of our clients will be people with Down Syndrome or other Intellectual disabilities, so the program should be as much easier as possible.
 
 We don't know how many people will attend to the coworker this first year but the place is really small. So we are looking for something easy, and cheap for the firts year. 
 
 Do you think your software could work for us?

 Your website's design is absolutely brilliant. The visuals really enhance your message and the content compels action. I've forwarded it to a few of my contacts who I think could benefit from your services.
 
  
 
 When I was looking at your site, though, I noticed a mistake that you've made re: search engine optimization which may be leading to a decline in your SEO results. It's a relatively simple fix. Would you like me to write it up so that you can share it with your web team? If this is a priority, I can also get on a call.

 At the end of the article, it invites those who run a coworking listing site, who believe they should be on the list, to contact the marketing team.
 
 
 
 So, that's what I'm doing :)
 
 
 
 We recently created a 'provider directory' as opposed to a space directory so we list all working space providers in London (all 394 of them) and throughout the UK, and Dublin, too. 
 
 
 
 London directory here: https://www.theofficeproviders.com/flexible-office-and-workspace-providers-london/
 
 
 
 We're currently doing the same for NYC.
 
 
 
 We are also regulated by the RICS (Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors) so we can help occupiers efficiently compare coworking/flexible spaces with leased office space options.

 My name is Josh Layton and we're currently designing a new website for one of your clients (Impact Hub Ottawa). The new website is being built on WordPress. I've tried to research to the best of my ability to see if Nexudus offers any kind of WordPress embed solutions for lead generation, or signing up for different co-working plans? Just thought I'd reach out directly and see if other clients have worked on a more intuitive WordPress integration before? 
 
 
 
 Thanks!

 I am running a coworking space in Sofia, Bulgaria (Biz Hub | Cowork | Events). We have 3 meeting rooms which are becoming more and more desirable, so we need to make the bizhubbers to book preliminary the room they want to use. What is special with our requirements is: 
 
 - to have one tablet, on a main spot, from which to be able to book all the three rooms. Not to have on each room a tablet. 
 
 - to be able to book it online, from a distance (I am at home and need to book a room for my team for tomorrow, for example). 
 
 - to be able to make limits per each company working at the space and eventually, to charge them once the make overtime, monthly. 
 
 - I am worried that the companies and freelancers, that are working from here, are not using one and the same platforms/ calendars. So, is it possible to be able for everybody to use their own platform (Outlook, Gsuite or else) on one system (Biz Hub). This, probably would not be a problem, because if we learn them - they will book the rooms for their needs, here, on the spot, on the tablet, but asking just in case.

,Other,"Hello,
 
 
 
 My name is Milan Šplíchal and I work in the social enterprise Ergotep, which employs people who are disadvantaged mainly by a disability. I read an article on your blog and I would like to commend you in the first place. You are true professionals.
 
 
 
 
 
 The social company Ergotep is based in the Pardubice Region in Proseč u Skutče and operates as a business entity with a social dimension. We already somehow naturally have in our thinking that what we do must bring a living to our employed people, but at the same time it should also help and have a social overlap if necessary. For this reason, I turn to you for help.
 
 
 
 
 
 One of my roles in the company is the work of a copywriter of the project https://www.whatspot.app. It is a reservation system for company resources. It is most often used by companies or various organizations to reserve meeting rooms, company cars, parking spaces or jobs. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Can you write our app in your article? (https://www.nexudus.com/blog/1414910213/top-5-meeting-room-booking-systems-for-coworking-and-flexible-workspaces/

 We have been using the demo account for our space for quite some time now to try out a few things and realised that - assuming we decide to go with it for our digital hub/coworking space - some form of workshop would probably be needed to learn how to use all the tools that Nexudus provides. I was wondering if you offer such courses or if people have to lean it on a ""do it yourself"" basis using your videos and documentation. If there are courses, how much are they and would they be offered in German?

 Hey,
 
 
 
 Your website's design is absolutely brilliant. The visuals really enhance your message and the content compels action. I've forwarded it to a few of my contacts who I think could benefit from your services. Many of our clients have also been noticing fluctuations in how their site is being found and used due to the Covid-19 pandemic - including attention gained from search, i.e. your SEO
 
 
 
 That being said, when I was looking at your site, though, I noticed a mistake that may be negatively impacting you re: search engine optimization. During this time of uncertainty, we are encouraging all business website owners to take advantage of every opportunity when it comes to their SEO. 
 
 
 
 What I found should be a relatively simple fix. Would you like me to write it up so that you can share it with your web team? If this is a priority, I can also get on a call.

 we, the TechQuartier are looking into a new tool to replace our current one (Cobot). We looking for a more efficient way to manage our community and space (currently increasing in numbers. We have 200+ members as of today, June 30th). We stumbled across your platform and would like to ask following questions:
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 - How much will the price increase if we get more than 200 members? 
 
 - How will the integration with Cisco Meraki and Iron Wifi work? Do we have to pay extra for it? How much?
 
 - Is it possible to make external bookings available on NEXUDUS – meaning: can non- members book and pay for bookings?
 
 - How much would the Salto KS addon cost?
 
 - We are currently facing one main issue, which is the link between NEXUDUS and GoCardless/ Stripe. In order to keep the transition as smooth as possible, especially with regard to cashflow, we would need to migrate the payment rights on Gocardless/ Stripe from Cobot to NEXUDUS. The support of Gocardless informed us that it should also not be an issue with them. To what extent can you support us in migrating our Gocardless authorizations? We would like to avoid customers having to reregister. Would that be possible?
 
 - And last question – do members have to opt-in in order for us to start charging? Meaning: can we just start charging them over NEXUDUS without their registration?
 
 
 
 I am looking forward to an offer including all the points above-mentioned.
 
 
 
 Thank you for your time and have a good day

 I sent you a note through your website's chat feature but believe I had the wrong email listed.
 
 
 
 I need to understand if your software can be used for our use case. In office space terms, we essentially have two desks in a room which can be booked individually by our members or they can book the room outright. If a desk is booked, another member would not be allowed to book the room outright, and vice versa, if the room was booked then another member could not book a desk. There are two desks in the room that can be booked by two members to share the room.
 
 
 
 The two desks and room all different price points (so we would not be setting price at the member level, it would be at the asset level or calculated). Can we set a price at this level, and if not, does it support a worktag/calculation at time of booking to set the price correctly?

 I'm helping our Commercial team find options to manage serviced offices and co-working spaces (plus meeting/conference rooms and other facilities) on an ambitious redevelopment project near Exeter. We will be looking to integrate 3-4 smaller sites in due course.
 
 
 
 We're pretty sure Nexudus will be a good fit - but need to understand the likelty cost before going further. To help you answer this, we expect the main site to host:
 
 
 
 - about 30 small companies with total 200-250 employees/members
 
 - about 50 co-working spaces
 
 - 4 x meeting rooms
 
 - 1 x event space
 
 
 
 Info on your pricing structure would be extremely helpful. Thank you.

Currently, we are building a new place for start-ups, including coworking and lab areas. And we need a software to run it, which is obviously why I am contacting you. Unfortunately there is some paperwork to do, before I am allowed to tell you more details. We need to sign a mutual NDA, that’s our corporate policy when approaching new vendors. Is that fine for you? If so, I would send you our standard NDA, which you would have to sign (or which you can modify, if you wish, of course), and then we would be ready for a demo with our internal stakeholders.
 
 
 
 In case you have any further questions so far, do not hesitate to contact me. I am looking forward to hearing back from you!",22/03/2021 08:46

,,"Hi. We have 1 location, consisting of multiple companies who wants a shared meeting solution to book and lookup our meeting rooms.
 
 
 
 I wish to know if you integrate with both Office 365 and Gmail and support multiple-company setups with various e-mail suppliers.
 
 
 
 In summary: We want to be able to book meetings directly from our Outlook or gmail, regardless of device (Windows, Mac, Linux) and mobile devices. Highly preferred if you have an app or responsive webapp we can use as shortcut on our devices.
 
 
 
 It's OK if the integration with various e-mail platforms is one-way communication. Meaning, that we can create/delete/modify meetings in the e-mail client, invite 3rd parties etc., and it shows up in your software. Its not a requirement that we modify in your software and it sync's back to our e-mail clients, but obviously that gives extra points :-) 
 
 
 
 If bookings are done through your software, we need to be able to send invites to 3rd parties directly in there, without having to create a separate invite on e-mail after.
 
 
 
 Please get back to me ASAP as I'm on a very tight deadline. 
 
 Hope it makes sense

 Hi, I'm Simon at swIDch. I heard about you from my connection at Impact Hub that it seems that our solution can be a great add-on to yours.
 
 
 
 Our patented code algorithm, which is only 4KB, can generate access code without use of active network. Therefore, it can eliminate associate costs of server maintenance, etc. On top up that, our code is dynamic which changes every time when user uses, and it can even reduce the friction at the same time.
 
 
 
 Please getting back so I can explain this in detail.
 
 
 
 Best,

 Returning to work requires new thinking. I appreciate your brief attention.
 
 
 
 My name is Andrew Petrowski and I am the Business Development Manager with Mapsted (www.mapsted.com).
 
 
 
 Mapsted has developed a unique hardware-free indoor navigation technology. So yes, that means no beacons involved, just software, allowing for no one ever to be lost indoors again (you can check out more in this 1-min video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOZd8Tp_QGE&ab_channel=Mapsted).
 
 
 
 We've been very successful so far (working with Fortune 100 companies and the public sector across six continents) and we want to expand our market reach by partnering with best-in-class software companies, like Nexudus. After taking a good look at your company and given that we target the same sectors like Enterprise Workplace we think that a potential partnership might be of interest to you.
 
 
 
 Also, we see that the Nexudus-Coworking platform supports key functions such as Space Utilization and Management, so it would be great for you to offer a value-added mapping/location positioning solution that's 100% software based and doesn't need beacons, wifi, or any external hardware.
 
 
 
 If that is the case, I'll be more than happy to schedule a brief meeting so we can explore this further.
 
 
 
 Warmest regards,
 
 Andrew",15/01/2021 19:22

 We're about to open an Anticafe in Iasi, Romania. We founded a social enterprise and our goal is to offer a space for work and development for people with difficulties in finding a job or starting a business. Our strategy is to offer them also some development programs in order to get the skills. This is the social part of the business. In order to be able to offer them these things we invite freelancers and entrepreneurs to come and work in our coworking space and charge them on a hourly fee basis. 
 
 I'm writing you asking about which of your products would be a best fit in order to have a good management for our space.
 
 Thank you,

 We have a customer that would like us to build an integration with Nexudus and we can also see a potential for other customers that use Nexudus to want this in the future.
 
 
 
 Would it be possible for us to get access to some kind of sandbox environment to test an integration during the development phase?
 
 Also if you have a technical contact person we could ask questions or maybe get a quick introduction to our dev team?

,,"Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren, 
 
 ich bin auf der Suche nach einem Raumbuchungssystem, das auch Rechnungen erstellt. Ich möchte mich erkundigen, ob Sie ein passendes Angebot für mich haben. Dazu würde ich gerne ein Beratungsgespräch mit Ihnen führen. Als Vorbereitung dazu möchte ich Ihnen im Folgenden meinen Bedarf darstellen und einzelne Anforderungen beschreiben, die mir wichtig sind.
 
 
 
 Grundidee
 
 Ich bin Psychotherapeutin und werde ab Januar 2021 in meiner Praxis 5 Räume stundenweise untervermieten. 
 
 Dabei schließe ich mit den Nutzern der Räume jeweils einen Untermietvertrag ab. Jeder Nutzer vereinbart eine feste Anzahl von Wochenstunden, die er jede Woche zu flexiblen Zeiten mieten kann. Bleiben in einer Woche Stunden offen, können diese nicht in die nächste Woche übertragen werden. 
 
 
 
 Preissystem
 
 Die Nutzer können ab 1 Stunde pro Woche einen Raum mieten. Je mehr Stunden pro Woche sie mieten, desto günstiger wird der Preis pro Stunde. Der Preis richtet sich also abgestuft nach der Anzahl der gemieteten Stunden. Dabei beginnt die Preisstaffelung bei 17,- €. Der Preis sinkt mit jeder Stunde, die der Nutzer fest pro Woche vereinbart, um 0,50 €.
 
 Die Nutzer können festlegen, wie viele Stunden sie jede Woche fest buchen. Der Zeitpunkt ist flexibel, sie können also zu allen freien Zeiten ihre Stunden reservieren. Lediglich die Anzahl der zu buchenden Stunden wird auf Wochenbasis fest vereinbart.
 
 Die monatliche Miete errechnet sich aus der für jede Woche gemieteten Anzahl von Stunden. Dazu kommen eventuelle zusätzliche Stunden, die darüber hinaus gebucht wurden. Ein Monat wird mit 30 Tagen angesetzt, das entspricht 4,3 Wochen.
 
 
 
 Beispiele:
 
 Nutzer A möchte pro Woche nur eine Stunde mieten. Diese kostet 17.- €.
 
 Er muss einen festen Mietpreis von 4,3 Wochen * 1 Wochenstunde *17,- € pro Monat zahlen. Monatsmiete: 73,10 €.
 
 
 
 Nutzer B möchte pro Woche 5 Stunden mieten. Der Preis hierfür ist günstiger, nämlich 17,- € minus 4*0,50 €, also 15,- € pro Stunde.
 
 Er muss einen festen Mietpreis von 4,3 Wochen * 5 Wochenstunden * 15,- pro Stunde zahlen. Monatsmiete: 322,50 €.
 
 
 
 Zu dem vereinbarten Stundenkontingent können die Nutzer zusätzliche Stunden spontan bis eine Stunde vor Beginn online buchen. Der Preis für Stunden, die über das vereinbarte Kontingent hinausgehen, ist 2,- € höher als der fest vereinbarte Preis.
 
 Beispiel:
 
 Nutzer B mietet pro Stunde wie oben beschrieben 5 Stunden. In einer Woche benötigt er spontan 7 Stunden, also 2 Stunden mehr als je Woche vereinbart. Diese kann er, sofern verfügbar, problemlos buchen. Die zusätzlich gebuchten Stunden sind allerdings 2,- € teurer als seine fest vereinbarten Stunden.
 
 Der Monatspreis für diesen Monat berechnet sich also aus dem fest vereinbarten Mietpreis von 322,50 € zuzüglich zwei Stunden zu je 15,- € + 2,- €. Also 34,- € zusätzlich. Monatsmiete: 322,50 + 34,- € = 356,50 €.
 
 
 
 Neben den 5 Therapieräumen vermiete ich für Seminare, Workshops oder Gruppentherapie unter der Woche und am Wochenende einen 30qm großen Seminarraum. Bei Bedarf können am Wochenende 3 weitere Räume für Kleingruppenarbeit mitgenutzt werden. 
 
 Hierfür sollen separate Buchungen möglich sein.
 
 
 
 Anforderungen an ein Buchungssystem
 
 Im Folgenden möchte ich Ihnen darstellen, welche Anforderungen ich an ein Raumbuchungs-&Rechnungssystem habe. Ich habe es aufgeteilt in allgemein, Administrator und Nutzeraccount.
 
 Allgemein
 
 System soll multiuserfähig sein und automatisch Backups erstellen
 
 Adminstratoraccount
 
 Ich als Administrator habe Zugriff auf/kann folgendes tun: 
 
 - Zugriff auf Kalender, Tarifoptionen, Preise
 
 - Ich möchte für jeden neuen Nutzer einen Account anlegen. Im Account möchte ich die Anzahl der fest vereinbarten Stunden und die dazu gehörenden Preise hinterlegen und ändern können. 
 
 - Eine monatliche Zusammenfassung der Rechnungen nach User soll automatisch erstellt werden, um Zahlungseingänge leichter kontrollieren zu können
 
 - Buchungssystem rechnet mir aus, wie viele Stunden pro Woche gerade fest vereinbart sind, nach Monaten aufgeschlüsselt
 
 - Statistik rückblickend: wie viele Stunden wurden tatsächlich gebucht, Summe (Fest vereinbarte und zusätzlich gebuchte Stunden)
 
 - Ich als Admin kann immer Räume buchen/reservieren (z.B. für Seminarbuchungen) und auch gebuchte Stunden von Nutzern ändern/stornieren
 
 - Automatische Rechnungserstellung durch Programm: je Nutzer Monatsrechnung erstellen unter Berücksichtigung der fest vereinbarten und zusätzlich gebuchten Stunden
 
 - Automatischer Rechnungsversand an die Nutzer durch Programm am 1. Des Monats für den vergangenen Monat
 
 - Evtl separat ausweisen: Mit oder ohne Umsatzsteuer
 
 
 
 Nutzeraccount
 
 Account für jeden Nutzer:
 
 - Für jeden Nutzer sollte sichtbar sein: 
 
 o Vereinbarte Wochenstunden und Stand der Stunden (noch offene Stunden und überschrittene Stunden, die extra in Rechnung gestellt werden)
 
 o Gebuchte Stunden im Kalender
 
 o Schon gestellte Rechnungen
 
 
 
 - Im Account für Nutzer werden dessen fest vereinbarte Wochenstunden und der Stundenstatus angezeigt, damit Nutzer selbst Überblick behalten kann. Mit Stundenstatus ist gemeint: Nutzer hat z.B. 3 Stunden pro Woche gemietet. Ihm soll angezeigt werden wie viele der 3 Stunden er in der jeweils betrachteten Woche schon im Kalender gebucht hat, wieviele Stunden noch in der jeweiligen Woche offen sind und wie viele Stunden er je Woche darüber hinaus gebucht hat, die er dann extra bezahlen muss.
 
 - Bei der Raumbuchung zeigt der Kalender für alle Räume an, welche Uhrzeiten schon gebucht sind und welche noch zur Verfügung stehen
 
 - Aus Datenschutzgründen, soll der Nutzer nur sehen, dass ein Raum schon gebucht ist, aber nicht von wem. Ausnahme: Der andere Nutzer hat zugestimmt, dass sein Name im Buchungssystem veröffentlicht wird.
 
 - Der Nutzer soll mehrere Stunden auf einmal zur Buchung auswählen können und nicht jede Stunde einzeln buchen müssen
 
 - Nutzer kann nur 1 Raum buchen zu einer Uhrzeit (Gemeinsame Buchung von Raum 1 und 2 nicht möglich, ergibt zusammen den Seminarraum)
 
 - Stornieren zu festgelegten Bedingungen. (Storno: Die Stunde ist wieder buchbar. Falls ein weiterer Nutzer die Stunde bucht: Keine abzurechnende Stundenbuchung vom Tarif/keine Stornogebühr. Falls sich keine Buchung der stornierten Stunde durch einen anderen Nutzer ergibt: Abzug der Stunde vom Stundenkontingent des Tarifs. Für über Tarif hinausgehende Stunden: gestaffelte Stornozahlung nach Vorlaufzeit) 
 
 
 
 Beispielablauf
 
 Den Ablauf einer Raumbuchung stelle ich mir ungefähr wie folgt vor: 
 
 Der Nutzer loggt sich ein
 
 1. Alle Räume werden im Kalender angezeigt: freie und gebuchte Stunden je Raum
 
 2. Anzeige auf Tages-, Wochen, Monatsbasis. Evtl. Jahresüberblick?
 
 3. Auswahl freier Stunden zur Buchung, Auswahl mehrerer Stunden auf einmal möglich
 
 4. Zusammenfassung und Kontrollmöglichkeit der ausgewählten Stunden
 
 a. Abgleich mit festgelegten Stunden
 
 b. Darstellung was an festgelegten Stunden noch offen ist oder darüber hinausgeht (=zusätzliche Kosten)
 
 5. Verbindliche Buchung
 
 6. Info zu Beginn des Folgemonats kommt Gesamtrechnung für aktuellen Monat
 
 
 
 Einbindung in eigene Website
 
 Ganz allgemein habe ich noch die Frage wie ich Ihr Angebot auf meiner Website einbinden kann. Kann sich der Nutzer über meine Website auf Ihren Kalender einloggen oder wird das über Ihre Website laufen?
 
 
 
 Ich freue mich auf Ihre Rückmeldung, ob Sie mir ein passendes Angebot machen können. 
 
 
 
 Vielen Dank im Voraus,

Our catalyst site exists within our own physical mixed use development and includes a 2,500sqm work space and 1,100sqm of ground floor amenity including a restaurant/cafe, bar/members club, white box conference space, full service gym and day spa.
 
 
 
 Our concerns and questions surround the level of UI alteration possible. As our ambition is to elevate the flexible working format to a luxury standard, we are unable to present our members with the same UI of functional appearance of the platform as a lesser grade coworking space.
 
 
 
 I'd like to arrange a Microsoft teams web call and discuss this, our business case and how we can move forward.

 2) Are you able to manage desk allocation per neighbourhood (groups) within each office building? i.e. each Manager can use this product to manage their own team's desk allocation dynamically.
 
 
 
 3) Real time staff metrics on desk & meeting room occupancy rates cross office locations. Can your product do this?
 
 
 
 4) Audit log of staff movements by staff name (desk and door). Can your product do this?

We are particularly interested in integrating with our current system, which is Salesforce. We want all information about individual users (personal data, e-mail, card number, room signatures) to be imported from this system. In addition, we use an outlook with a list of rooms, however, such a reservation system only serves our receptionists. In a word... A lot still has to be done, and given our status as one of the leaders of coworking services in Poland we have to find a satisfactory solution as soon as possible.

,,"Hello Nexudus,
 
 
 
 We are SITIO a network of shared spaces, for working and living in Portugal. At this moment we have 19 locations, and 2 under production, with plans of continuing to expand the network over the next few years. At this point we have over 1000 desks and nearly 100rooms. 
 
 Presently we are in the process of changing our backoffice management software to ease our management and continue improving our service for our members. This is something I would like to decide on in the next month and have its development/training of the team during September so that in October it is fully up and running with our members. 
 
 I was in your site, looking over your offer and have a few questions I would like to make. Some are technical, other commercial. 
 
 Starting with the technical ones:
 
 - In terms of integration of access controls, with which sytems or providers have you already got the programming fully functional? We use Salto System (the largest supplier worldwide), is that OK? if not that’s a dealbreaker. 
 
 - We provide every member a card for opening doors. Does Nexudus have a backoffice area where we can manage this information.
 
 - In terms of management info, what type of info can I get from your dashboards? what reports and info can I extract? 
 
 - Have you got integrations programmed with management and accountancy softwares? In our case we use PHC. 
 
 - Nexudus by allowing for the billing and payments to be done directly over the software, does it comply with the national AT (Autoridade Tributárias) protocols of invoicing? 
 
 - Does the program export the monthly SAFT document?
 
 - How does the software work in terms of having my portfolio of rooms, desks, meeting rooms listed and then, when necessary, placed online to create adverts?
 
 - Does the software have a channel managing system for online platforms?
 
 - We are imminently closing a deal for a cloud phone system. Do you have such a offer ou is it possible to integrate this phone providers CRM with nexudus, to make Nexudus the base management system.
 
 - Although our main focus is the coworking spaces, the coliving side of the business is also important and both live hand in hand. I don’t see a major difference (in terms of management software) between a closed office space (for x people) and a bedroom (for x people). Do you believe we could use Nexudus for both operations? This would be extremely important to simplify or communications and management.
 
 Commercial questions:
 
 - The automatic pricing algorithm on the site, only provides price up to 500 members. I suppose when the number is above the need for a specific offer comes into play. By the end of 2020 we will have 1200 desks, and planning to continue to grow up to 3000 desks. Although not each desk is a member, due to vacancy and many time people rent more desks than the number of workers but I would like to know where you can get to in terms of price point.
 
 - Are all services included in the presented price? What are add-ons with extra cost that we need to know for the future?
 
 
 
 I would very much like to know if Nexudus can be the right fit for us, but for that I need to understand these issues I have presented. Although a written aswser is great if you are available for a videocall to better understand we are available. 
 
 Hope to hear back from you asap.
 
 
 
 All the best,
 
 Pedro Snow

 The general idea is that user is able to login to the application using their AD, perform booking on a desk. At their booking time, they're required to check-in to confirm their usage. Else the desk would be open up for other team member.
 
 
 
 Therefore, can I request for a demo of the admin portal and user mobile application to try ou tthe following function
 
 - Requires user to check in to booking for Booking Confirmation.
 
 - Ability to set booking rules such as no overlapping booking and/or qouta for user
 
 - Integration with AD for SSO.
 
 - Easy Resource Booking on the go",22/07/2020 05:03

,,"Hi,
 
 We are looking for a new coworking software to manage our space, you will find below our specification, we would like to know if your platform is compatible with them, and as we have a lot of drop ins / visitors we would like to make sure what type of customers would be considered as ""active members"" based on our various cases.
 
 Thanks in advance ! 
 
 
 
 Case 1 : visitor hot desk
 
 The visitor checks in at the cashier, a time tracker is started associated with either a dummy contact or the customer contact if filled in.
 
 When the customer checks out, the cashier stops the counter. A total of the time spent is displayed.
 
 If a customer checks out for a short period of time (eg. For lunch), the time tracker has to be able to start again, at the previous indicated time the starting point.
 
 Prices to be implemented :
 
 è 1st h -> 5€ vat incl
 
 è +30 min blocks -> 2.5€ vat incl
 
 è Full day (above the 5th hour) -> 25€ vat incl
 
 An invoice should be sent through email, if the customer provides it.
 
 Invoice should be either edited at the check out OR at the end of the month, with a synthesis of the month consumption, if a contact form is filled in and the option selected.
 
 
 
 Case 2 : visitor meeting box
 
 The visitor checks in at the cashier, a time tracker is started associated with either a dummy contact or the customer contact if filled in.
 
 When the customer checks out, the cashier stops the counter. A total of the time spent is displayed.
 
 If a customer checks out for a short period of time (eg. For lunch), the time tracker has to be able to start again, at the previous indicated time as the starting point.
 
 Prices to be implemented :
 
 è 1st h -> 18€ vat incl
 
 è +30 min blocks -> 9€ vat incl
 
 è After the 3rd hour -> +30min blocks = 5€ vat incl
 
 è After the 6th hour -> +30min blocks = 2.5€ vat incl
 
 
 
 An invoice should be sent through email, if the customer provides it.
 
 Invoice should be either edited at the check out OR at the end of the month, with a synthesis of the month consumption, if a contact form is filled in and the option selected.
 
 Box booking should be available online for all users on our website (wordpress), a compatible widget is a valid option. 
 
 Case 3 : prepaid users
 
 The customer prepays a card and get a bonified credit to be use on hotdesk only.
 
 è Pay 100 € - get 115€ credit
 
 è Pay 250 € - get 305€ credit
 
 è Pay 500 € - get 750€ credit
 
 
 
 The credit is then deducted on the same basis than the regular visitor 
 
 è 1st h -> 5€
 
 è +30 min blocks -> 2.5€
 
 è Full day (above the 5th hour) -> 25€
 
 
 
 This credit is also usable for meeting box rentals : 
 
 è 1st h -> 18€ vat incl
 
 è +30 min blocks -> 9€ vat incl
 
 è After the 3rd hour -> +30min blocks = 5€ vat incl
 
 è After the 6th hour -> +30min blocks = 2.5€ vat incl
 
 The time tracker operates in the same way
 
 The customer should be able to access to the remaining funds online, and pay for a refill online.
 
 Invoice should be send by email, with the possibility of printing from the cashier.
 
 
 
 Case 4 : larger meeting room booking
 
 Meeting rooms are bookable by both coworking customers and outside visitors.
 
 The availibity is shown online.
 
 Every booking has to be validated, a quotation is realized prior booking.
 
 The quotation should allow additional items such as coffee breaks, food buffet, etc. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Case 5 : Coworking for companies
 
 Invoice should be made under the company name.
 
 Billing should be made following consumption for every employee of the company.
 
 Plans should be available either on a monthly basis per employee, per company, or on a prepaid feature similar to case 2 (amount of discount / bonus credit can vary).
 
 --
 
 Ideally, time consumption is tracked through a NFC Card (Mifare or similar), issued for every customer. It should also be possible to launch the time tracking manually.",09/07/2020 15:12

 - I am a consultant charged with starting and potentially running a new flexible workplace operation in Australia.
 
 - My client is an institutional grade Landlord/Developer in the Australian market and at this stage insists on confidentiality.
 
 - The business model is for a min of 100 desks and max of 200 desks per site. Growth is set for 10 sites over 3 years (first opening Feb 2021) 
 
 - We have made the decision to use 3rd party CRM (MRM) for the business and as such are approaching 3 operators deemed to be market leaders.
 
 - The nexedus product has is comprehensive and has impressed and we would like to have some discussions both around initial 3 site pricing and also what longer term relationship benefits may exist. 
 
 Rather than go straight into demo I would like to have a discussion about what I have written and your offering. My best contact number is +61410548817 or happy to set up Zoom etc.
 
 Looking forward to further chats.

,,"Hello,
 
 
 
 I’m evaluating different systems for room reservation and unlocking. We have property with two rooms for shared usage. There are around 80 users and we want to automate the coordination of reservations and access control. The intention is, that users reserve the rooms on a daily or half-daily basis and automatically get access to them with their smartphone apps during their reservation through your access control integrations. 
 
 
 
 Can you please let me know if your solution is capable of the following:
 
 • Each user has its personal account
 
 • There is one admin account that can create new users and manage them
 
 • We can force users to first accept our terms of use before completing a reservation
 
 • Reservation don’t need approval by an admin and should be automatically accepted
 
 • Reservations are always for free
 
 • Two rooms are supported
 
 • Reservations can only be made 2 month in advance
 
 • If a users wants to make a reservation more than 2 months in advance, approval from an admin is required
 
 • There is a smartphone app (ios & Android) for users
 
 • Users can unlock the door with your app directly
 
 • Users need a different app to unlock doors
 
 • We can show some information related to reservations in the app (contact of caretaker, etc)
 
 • The users App offers English language
 
 • The users App offers German language
 
 • What support do you offer (phone, e-mail, German, English)
 
 • All cloud-based, no servers needed
 
 • What is your one-time and monthly cost for 80 users, 1 admin and 2 rooms
 
 
 
 I would appreciate a quick feedback by today so that I can pass that information to the property owner. Thank you",12/06/2020 09:48

 Requirements for booking software
 
 1) Customer signs up and gets assigned a permanent 5 digit numerical customer number. (this becomes their permanent pin number for key pad)
 
 2) Owner has the ability to create time slots in 15 min preferred, or 30 minute increments time slots. (example 8:15am-9am or 8am-9:30am) 
 
 3) Each time slot needs assigned a numerical number (access code number) that is viewable to the owner either created by the system or manually entered by the owner. 
 
 4) The customer number and access code number needs sent a day before booking to Galaxy access control via a Restfull API once payment is received. 
 
 5) Galaxy system is already set up that if customer 10001 has 7pm-8pm booked on Monday = Access code 78 and the booking app sends 10001 = 78 that week. The key pad will be active from 6:45pm to 8:15pm. 
 
 6) There will be two courts with the same pricing model
 
 7) I will need the flexibility to create peak and off peak pricing during a day. In addition, I will need to be able to create weekday time slots in 1 ½ hour increments and weekends in 1 hour increments with different pricing options for summer and winter. 
 
 8) My current website. https://book.mvpsportsarena.com/#!/home

This could possibly help with contract tracing if necessary. Is your platform able to do this? And do you offer education discounts or anything for non-profit educational institutions?

 We're opening a co-working space and need some booking software. The space offers 2/3 day memberships and day passes. 
 
 
 
 Requirements:
 
 - 50 memberships, but only 25 desks, so need feature where members can book a desk in advance. So we dont turn people away. Much like a gym class.
 
 - Most memberships options are 2/3day per week but want option to buy extra working days with embedded payment etc.
 
 - Each member to have their own 'portal' where they can see their attendance? (note essential)
 
 - Meeting room booking options
 
 - Ability to embed software in our website (non essential)
 
 
 
 Or if you think there is a simpler way of booking we'd love to hear from you. 
 
 
 
 Thanks,

 My name is Alex and I run a growth marketing firm in Australia.
 
 
 
 A client of mine is keen to use your Nexudus platform for a new coworking space they are creating.
 
 
 
 They have asked me to lead the project for them. They essentially want to:
 
 Drive content.
 
 Create a portal for members.
 
 Include a member logged in area where I can put reports, articles and member-only content.
 
 Be able to design the interface so it looks like their brand: How changeable is your platform? Is it the case of being able to design elements that fit within your front end wireframes? Or can I drag and drop.
 
 I look forward to hearing from you.
 
 
 
 Thanks,
 
 Alex.

 You might get a better idea checking www.ayresdigital.com. 
 
 We have built several residential buildings, corporate buildings, comercial stores, restaurants, and still under construction a Convention Center, more comercial buildings, cowork spaces, shopping mall.
 
 As I see we can use your software to make the whole place work as a co-living&working space, where all services are administered by your software.
 
 Have you had any experience on something like this? I guess the software pretty much covers everything we are thinking about implementing in the comunity:
 
 social wifi (unifi hardware), access control to buildings and spaces (hikvision), space renting, meeting rooms, zoom services, printing services, vending machines, etc...
 
 We will probably build this platform under AYRES DIGITAL. 
 
 Let me know if you can help organizing steps to follow and how to integrate your platform with hikvision access controls, MERCADO PAGO?? (Payment platform in Argentina avoiding 30% country tax by not paying abroad), etc.

 My name is Alex and I run a growth marketing firm in Australia.
 
 
 
 A client of mine is keen to use your Nexudus platform for a new coworking space they are creating.
 
 
 
 They have asked me to lead the project for them. They essentially want to:
 
 Drive content.
 
 Create a portal for members.
 
 Include a member logged in area where I can put reports, articles and member-only content.
 
 Be able to design the interface so it looks like their brand: How changeable is your platform? Is it the case of being able to design elements that fit within your front end wireframes? Or can I drag and drop.
 
 I look forward to hearing from you.
 
 
 
 Thanks,
 
 Alex.

,,"Bonjour,
 
 Je suis en charge de la mise en oeuvre, en début d'année 2020, d'un Tiers Lieux à Rethel (Ardennes, 08), pour le compte de la communauté de communes du pays rethélois.
 
 
 
 La Communauté de communes du Pays Rethélois est à la recherche d'un prestataire capable de lui fournir une solution intégrée de gestion de son futur Tiers Lieux.
 
 Nous avons besoin d'une solution nous permettant de gérer :- les accès au local et aux pièces se situant à l'intérieur, avec créneaux horaires prédéfinis, via serrures connectées et QR Code;=> en contact avec des prestataires spécialisées, avec lesquels vous aurez à travailler pour coordonner la plate-forme de gestion/réservation;- la réservation des espaces pour les utilisateurs;(si possible l'envoi d'un sms aux utilisateurs 15 minutes avant la fin de leur créneau)- l'acceptation par les utilisateurs des conditions d'utilisation des espaces avec engagement d'assurance;- le paiement en ligne des utilisateurs avec encaissement pour notre compte (modalités à définir);- si possible l'intégration de la videosurveillance sur notre back-office;- un fichier des utilisateurs avec coordonnées complètes sur notre back-office;- la gestion de l'occupation des espaces sur notre back-office.
 
 Cet outil devra être accessible via notre site Internet / application : http://www.paysrethelois.fr/ et nous pourrons de notre côté la gérer à distance via ordinateur / smartphone ou tablette.
 
 Les espaces et accès de notre futur Tiers Lieux se définissent comme suit, et devront faire l'objet d'autorisations d'accès indépendants, mais parfois cumulables :- l'entrée du bâtiment (l'entrée est partagée avec notre bailleur, il faudra donc prévoir un/plusieurs code(s) propre(s) pour ce dernier)- l'entrée de notre local- la salle de réunion- bureau 1- bureau 2 - bureau 3- local technique (uniquement pour nous)
 
 Pour information, la Communauté de communes du Pays rethélois représente 65 communes pour 30 000 habitants et se situe dans le département des Ardennes (08).
 
 La ville de Rethel, la plus importante de notre collectivité, se situe à 30 minutes de Reims (51) et 1h30 de train de Paris.
 
 Vous remerciant par avance pour votre proposition, je reste à votre disposition pour tout complément. Merci d'avance de me faire une réponse mail, avec proposition tarifaire, afin que nous convenions d'un RV téléphonique.
 
 Cordialement,

 We already tried one time Nexudus but had not the time to really check it. Right now we were offered another platform, but I think I prefer Nexudus. I have a few questions though:
 
 -what is the definition of a member? Also the employees of a client? So if we have a client with 50 people working for them, are that 50 members or is that 1 member according to the pricing?
 
 -do I need to pay per location or for the total of my members?
 
 -what is exactly included in the price, and for what do I need to pay extra? I understand that all applications from outside are extra, but do you have a platform for members included? The invoicing is included? The app is included? The CRM is included> Etc etc...
 
 Hope to hear from you!
 
 thanks a lot

 Together with you as a partner, a software integration company, we would like to further develop our digital key solution for a customer in a current project.
 
 
 
 It is a Co-Working space and we want to digitize 14 doors and equip them with our solution. Now we need a provider for the software connection between the key and the hardware.
 
 
 
 We have developed a lock/key solution based on blockchain technology that enables digitalization while ensuring the highest level of security. This solution is already running on 20 cars on Streetscooter (subsidiary of DHL) and is easy to use with a smartphone. All opening and closing procedures are documented in a verifiable way and cannot be falsified.
 
 
 
 Are you the right contact for this type of project? Does this sound interesting for you? Could you send me an offer for my inquiry or could we schedule a call for next week?

We are looking for a system to organize and manage that space. 
 
 We need to manage tenants, reserve conference rooms, give access to rooms and areas via digital keys (phone and key card/chip) and if possible pay via app in the cafeteria and at coffee dispensers.
 
 Could you please make us an offer for your system, including pricing and functions you can offer us.

 I am Majlida Dervishi, Project Officer at Open Data Kosovo. Firstly, Open Data Kosovo is a nonprofit organization that believes in using civic-tech and digital humanitarianism to open government. Open Data Kosovo champions the opening of data through different digital solutions that have been developed by our team.
 
 
 
 While the projects that we are leading are donor-funded, Open Data Kosovo has decided to offer Coworking services in order to contribute to the organization’s sustainability and enable the organization’s financial security and possibility to further contribute to the community with the added resources.
 
 
 
 For that reason, I am writing to you to ask if you have any special policy towards offering your product/service to NGOs so that you can help us work towards our mission?;While keeping in mind that NGOs do not have enough resources to pursue different activities that not only benefit the organization, but also those that are the target beneficiaries of our work. 
 
 
 
 We currently have only one location and can accommodate up to 25 people. 
 
 
 
 If you need further information, please do not hesitate to contact me. 
 
 
 
 Thank you for considering our request. 
 
 
 
 Best,

 I am part of a team undertaking a final year University module named Entrepreneurial Skills. Our aim for the module is to set up a business focusing on improving accessibility to the growing market of flexible office space. From researching the gaps in the market, we have developed NetDesk, an online and app-based platform that facilitates the booking of short-term office space. We are now in the process of sorting the finances for out proposed app.
 
 
 
 We would just like to get a bit more information about Nexudus to inform some of the costs around our app and the potential for having external software providers to help us manage out booking platform. 
 
 
 
 Any information you could offer on your prices and services would be very helpful. 
 
 
 
 NetDesk is planning of having a number of office space locations across the UK and is predicting around 30,000 transactions on our app by year 3.
 
 
 
 Whilst we are in the process of developing NetDesk, we believe it has real-world application and are hoping to gain your feedback, and see whether this service would be of interest. For further reference, please see our website: www.netdeskapp.com
 
 
 
 We would love the opportunity to schedule a call or meeting to discuss your thoughts, or appreciate any feedback via email if preferable.

 I am the developer at Workbar, a network of coworking spaces in the New England region of the United States.
 
 
 
 We currently use our own proprietary coworking platform Wobbe to manage 10 of our own locations whose active membership exceeds 1600. In addition, we have partnered with 10 regional coworking operators who use our platform to help manage their own spaces.
 
 
 
 I believe Workbar reached out to Nexudus in the spring/summer of 2018 to judge the feasibility of migrating Workbar's and its partners' operations from our internal platform Wobbe onto yours.
 
 
 
 Both the development team and leadership here at Workbar have changed substantially in the last six months, but the problem at hand for us remains the same: is it more cost-effective to migrate to a more robust platform such as Nexudus versus maintaining and extending our own?
 
 
 
 Is it possible to schedule another demo with Nexudus for what remains of our team?
 
 
 
 I would be happy to discuss or write up any of our unique requirements if it would save you time in helping us make an informed decision.
 
 
 
 Thank you,
